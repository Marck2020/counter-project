About The Project
The project you are going to see her is a simple counter with multiple buttons and the text field.

You will se a 0 (zero) in the center of the page and many buttons around it with different possibilities (-1, -5, -10, +10, +5 and so on...) so the the user can increment and decrement the counter as it they want to.

Furthermore I inserted a text field with two buttons "ADD" and "SUBTRACT". The user can insert whatever number inside and add it or subtract it to the previous one.


Built With

-HTML
-CSS
-JAVASCRIPT


Getting Started

In order for you to start the project, please make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer and webpack. Then you can download the package, making sure the file "index.js" is and remains in the "src" folder and all the other files are where they belong to.


Prerequisites

Then please open up the powershell into the main project folder and simply execute this code:

npm run build


Installation

This will automatically generate the "dist" folder and the "bundle.js" file inside it.

Without this file, the counter won't work locally on your computer, so please make sure the "npm run build" works. If it doesn't, make sure you downlodaded the whole package and all the files on your local folder appear as they do on github, with the only additional "dist" folder
generated by webpack.

After that, you can simply open up open the "index.html" file with yout browser and enjoy the counter.


Usage


You can use this counter as a simple calculator for additions and subtractions or to keep track of the points of a game.
